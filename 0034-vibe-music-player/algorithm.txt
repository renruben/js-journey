**Algorithm for Vibe Music Player**

1. **Initialize Music List:**
   - Create an array `music` containing objects with `title`, `artist`, `src` (audio file path), and `cover` (image path).
   - Define a variable `currentMusic` to track the currently playing song index.

2. **Access DOM Elements:**
   - Retrieve elements using `getElementById` for the cover image, song title, artist name, audio element, seek bar, current time, total time, and control buttons.

3. **Play/Pause Button Functionality:**
   - Add an event listener to `playPauseBtn`.
   - If the audio is paused, play it and change the button icon to a pause symbol.
   - If the audio is playing, pause it and change the button icon to a play symbol.

4. **Next Button Functionality:**
   - Add an event listener to `nextBtn`.
   - Increment `currentMusic` to the next song index (looping back to the start if at the last song).
   - Call `loadMusic(currentMusic)` to update the player with the new song.
   - Auto-play the new song and update the play button to a pause symbol.

5. **Previous Button Functionality:**
   - Add an event listener to `prevBtn`.
   - Decrement `currentMusic` to the previous song index (looping to the last song if at the first song).
   - Call `loadMusic(currentMusic)` to update the player with the new song.
   - Auto-play the new song and update the play button to a pause symbol.

6. **Load Music Function (`loadMusic(i)`)**
   - Update the cover image, song title, artist name, and audio source based on the index `i`.
   - Reset the seek bar to 0.

7. **Initialize Music on Page Load:**
   - Call `loadMusic(currentMusic)` to set up the first song when the page loads.

8. **Update Total Duration of Song:**
   - Listen for the `loadedmetadata` event on the `audio` element.
   - Display the total duration of the song using the `time()` function.

9. **Update Seek Bar and Current Time:**
   - Listen for the `timeupdate` event on the `audio` element.
   - Update the seek bar position based on `audio.currentTime`.
   - Display the formatted current time using the `time()` function.

10. **Seek Bar Manual Adjustment:**
    - Listen for the `input` event on the `seekBar`.
    - Adjust `audio.currentTime` based on the seek bar position.

11. **Format Time (`time(seconds)`)**
    - Convert total seconds into minutes and seconds.
    - Ensure seconds are displayed with two digits (e.g., `3:05`).
    - Return the formatted time string.
