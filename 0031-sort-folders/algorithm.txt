### **Algorithm for Sorting Folder

1. **Initialize Folder Container**  
   - Select the .folder-container element to cover child folders.  

2. **Create New Folder**  
   - When the "Create Folder" button is clicked:  
     - Generate a unique `folderId` using the current date time.
     - Create a new `div` element for the folder.  
     - Add a folder icon and an input field for naming.  
     - Append the folder to `.folder-container`.  
     - Focus the input field immediately to write folder name.  

3. **Handle Folder Naming**  
   - When the user clicks away from the input field (`blur` event):  
     - If the input is empty, remove the folder. (It will not be considered.)  
     - Otherwise, replace the input tag with a `span` containing the folder name.  
   - If the user presses "Enter," the input is confirmed and replaced.  

4. **Sort Folders by Name**  
   - When the "Sort by Name" button is clicked:  
     - Retrieve all folder elements with querySelectorAll.
     - Sort them alphabetically.  
     - Reappend them in the sorted order. (Using forEach)  

5. **Sort Folders by Date**  
   - When the "Sort by Date" button is clicked:  
     - Retrieve all folder elements with querySelectorAll.
     - Sort them based on their `folderId` (creation date).  
     - Reappend them in the sorted order. (Using forEach)
