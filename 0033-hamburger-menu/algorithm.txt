**Algorithm for Toggle Hamburger Menu**

1. **Initialize State:**
   - Set a boolean variable `open` to `false`, indicating that the menu is initially closed.

2. **Add Click Event Listener:**
   - Attach an event listener to the element with ID `hamburger`.
   - When the `hamburger` element is clicked, execute the following steps:

3. **Toggle Menu Visibility:**
   - Select the element with ID `mobile-menu`.
   - Toggle its `hidden` class, which acts as an on/off switch.
   - Add transition effects: `transition`, `ease-in-out`, and `duration-300` for smooth animations.

4. **Update State:**
   - Check whether `mobile-menu` contains the `hidden` class.
   - If `hidden` is **not present**, set `open = true` (menu is open).
   - If `hidden` is **present**, set `open = false` (menu is closed).

5. **Apply Animation to Hamburger Icon:**
   - If `open` is `true` (menu is open):
     - Select `.top` bar and apply:
       - `rotate-45`
       - `translate-y-1`
       - `transition`
       - `duration-300`
     - Hide `.middle` bar by removing `block`.
     - Select `.bottom` bar and apply:
       - `-rotate-45`
       - `-translate-y-1`
       - `transition`
       - `duration-300`
   
   - If `open` is `false` (menu is closed):
     - Select `.top` bar and remove:
       - `rotate-45`
       - `translate-y-1`
       - `transition`
       - `duration-500`
     - Show `.middle` bar by adding `block`.
     - Select `.bottom` bar and remove:
       - `-rotate-45`
       - `-translate-y-1`
       - `transition`
       - `duration-500`
